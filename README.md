# Final Week Guidelines

During your final week at DevLeague, you have a couple of final assignments inorder to better prepare you as you re-enter the job market.

1. Schedule a mock interview with an Instructor.
1. Have your resume reviewed by an Instructor or TA.
1. Prepare your portfolio.
1. Clean up your social media presence.

## Mock Interview
DevLeague believes in the value of an authentic interview experience. As with every skill you've ever learned, you have to learn the technique and then practice, practice, practice. A mock interview will not only help you perfect your technique, but it will also allow you to get valuable feedback and coaching on your performance.

### How to Prep for a Mock Interview
* **Know yourself and the potential employer** - spend time thinking about your goals, talents, skills, abilities, and experiences (what positive stories can you tell).
* **Research before you go** - find literature or information online about the organization and its products so you are well informed.
* **Create Your Elevator Speech** - prepare a 2-5 minute sales pitch about yourself and rehearse with a friend or family.
* **Make a list of 5 questions to ask the interviewer about the organization and/or the position.**
* **Practice Whiteboarding** - Solve problems without the aid of your text editor or the internet. Be sure to practice talking through your solution outloud. You will look crazy talking to yourself, this is okay.
* **Review Algorithms** - Sorting algorithms, Linked Lists, Red Black trees, Search algorithms, etc.
* **Review Concepts** - Review vocab, design patterns, frameworks, libraries
* **Practice coding problems** - Practice solving code interview style questions from [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Coder Byte](https://coderbyte.com/), [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com/), and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Try setting time limits for yourself, or solving them on a whiteboard
* **Look sharp**

## Clean Up Your Social Media Presence
Like or hate it, your social media profiles are an extension of your resume. Roughly 80% of recruiters and hiring managers use social media to look for and vet job candidates, making it extremely important to have a professional presence on the Internet.

* **Check Your Facebook Privacy Settings** - To maintain your privacy, it’s important to have your Facebook account set to friends only.
* **Search Yourself** - Most of us don’t know everything that’s published about us online. In addition to the content we publish, friends and colleagues sometimes share about us, too. Are you sure everything out there is appropriate?
* **Delete Abandoned Social Media Accounts**
* **Think Before You Post**
