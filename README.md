## Mock Interview
DevLeague believes in the value of an authentic interview experience. 

### How to Prep for a Mock Interview
* Know yourself and the potential employer - spend time thinking about your goals, talents, skills, abilities, and experiences (what positive stories can you tell).
* Research before you go - find literature or information online about the organization and its products so you are well informed.
* Create Your Elevator Speech - prepare a 2-5 minute sales pitch about yourself and rehearse with a friend or family.
* View and Prepare for common Standard and Behavioral Interview/S.T.A.R Questions. Questions can be found in Richland Library Job Center handouts, interview preparation books, the internet, and YouTube.
* Make a list of 5 questions to ask the interviewer about the organization and/or the position.
* Study mock interview feedback and continue to use this service until you feel comfortable with the interview process.
